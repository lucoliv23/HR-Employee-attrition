## Case Study - HR Employee Attrtion Dataset

# Context

McCurr Health Consultancy is an MNC that has thousands of employees spread across the globe. The company believes in hiring the best talent available and retaining them for as long as possible. A huge amount of resources is spent on retaining existing employees through various initiatives. The Head of People Operations wants to bring down the cost of retaining employees. 

For this, he proposes limiting the incentives to only those employees who are at risk of attrition. As a recently hired Data Scientist in the People Operations Department, you have been asked to identify patterns in characteristics of employees who leave the organization. Also, you have to use this information to predict if an employee is at risk of attrition. This information will be used to target them with incentives.
